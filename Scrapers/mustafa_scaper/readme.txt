So I built this scraper. In order to get it running there are three things you need to do.

1:
Get beautiful soup installed on your machine

pip install beautifulsoup4

2:
Get selenium webdriver installed on your machine

pip install selenium

3: 
I attached a geckodriver in the repo... add this file to the same folder where your python is located in the path

I will add comments to make the scraper easier to use!
